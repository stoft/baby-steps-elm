# Baby Steps Exercises

These are exercises constructed with the goal of imcrementally letting you familiarize yourself with the Elm standard libraries in a process of discovery.

Each exercise consists of small steps that will lead you to discover a new library and to write a functioning program.

Each step in turn has hints in the form of links to packages and functions that will aid you in solving each step. Only use them if you get stuck, your own discovery process is what will cement the knowledge and you may discover other things on the way that will help somewhere else in the future. Remember also that these hints aren't necessarily the only way to solve a certain step!

After each step, verify your result using either elm-reactor or the online editor at http://elm-lang.org/try. This will give you quick wins motivating you to move forward.

Example solutions will be included where possible. There are no guarantees that these are optimal solutions. ;)
