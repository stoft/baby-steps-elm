# Baby Steps Exercises

These are exercises constructed with the goal of imcrementally letting you familiarize yourself with the Elm standard libraries in a process of discovery.

Each exercise consists of small steps that will lead you to discover a new library and to write a functioning program. After each step, verify your result using either elm-reactor or the online editor at http://elm-lang.org/try. This will give you quick wins motivating you to move forward.

Example solutions will be included where possible. There are no guarantees that these are optimal solutions. ;)
